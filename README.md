ThinkPad Fan Control 2, a fan control utility for ThinkPad users running Windows 10/11

## About

This is a fork of the [original TPFC](https://github.com/ThinkPad-Forum/TPFanControl/tree/master/fancontrol), and is based on 
[byrnes' dual fan mod](https://github.com/byrnes/TPFanControl).
It's updated it to work with two fan devices. The default fan profile prioritizes fan noise, with fans only turning on at 60C. This can be changed by editing 
`tpfancontrol.ini`.

Visual Studio 2022 Community was used to build and debug.

**Important: This software is released as a public domain software, there is no warranty or promise of bug fixes. The binaries and its source code are provided "as is", 
and should be used at your own risk. For more information, please refer to <http://unlicense.org/>.**

Please note that I'm very busy with other work for the time being so it'll take a while for me to get to new issues, however please feel free to create pull requests,
I will review those as soon as possible.

## Requirements

To avoid errors, either install [tvicport](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/dev/port/index.shtm) manually or install the original version of TPFanControl found 
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tp4xfancontrol/) (source code [here](https://github.com/ThinkPad-Forum/TPFanControl)), 
and run the dual-fan version instead of the original version.

Administration permission is required for the program to be able to control system fan speed.

Windows 10 or 11 is required to run the program. Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8 may work, but are untested and should not be expected to.


## Configuring

You can configure the behaviour of the program by editing the values inside the `TPFanControl.ini` file that comes with the program,

The `TPFanControl.ini` file should always be in the same directory as the `fancontrol.exe` executable file.

Example of configurable parameters:

- Temperature refresh cycle time
- Start minimized in the taskbar tray
- Max read errors before the program auto shuts down
- Log program log to file & log data to CSV file
- Configure the fan curve in smart mode
- Configure a second smart mode that is accessable in the tray
- Temperature threshold to exit the manual mode

### Manual Fan Levels

| Normal: | Advanced:|
| --- | ----------- |
| 0 - Off | 0 - Off |
| 1 - 30% | 50 - 40% |
| 2 - 40% | 60 - 60% |
| 3 - 45% | 70 - 100% |
| 4 - 50% | 80 - 100% |
| 5 - 60% |
| 6 - 65% |
| 7 - 65% |

<h5>Advanced level value is converted into hex before being read by the EC, the value above is a rough estimate of what to expect</h5>

<h5>The 0-7 range is intended to be used as the fan levels intended by the manufacture (7 being the highest that the laptop BIOS can go), and to take full advantage of 
the fan you'll need to enter 0-128 in hex (for example, 128 in hex is 0x80, which is entered as 80).</h5>

### Additional Information

You can find additional information here on the ThinkPad Wiki: [https://thinkwiki.de/TPFanControl](https://thinkwiki.de/TPFanControl).


## Building Instructions

Building this program requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community

The project should have the correct configuration upon opening the project file `fancontrol.sln`, though you might have to manually copy and paste the `.ini` file into 
the Debug folder to test the built program

The project currently builds with the configuration: `Debug` `Win32` (You will need admin permission to run the built program)

Do not build the project without TPFCIcon and TPFCIcon_noballons, they are necessary parts of the application and the main fan control software will not function without 
them

The source code of spinoff releases of the program (i.e. 2.1.5 B) for different machines are stored within the archive direcotry, you can build them by subsituting the 
main fancontrol directory with the fancontrol directory of the desiered version. Note that TPFCIcon and TPFCIcon_noballons should stay the same for every release.

### Note

If you get Linker Tools Error LNK2026: module unsafe for SAFESEH image when building:

- Go to Project properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Advanced
- Disable option `Image has Safe Exception Handlers` (No (/SAFESEH:NO)

## Running at startup (Not Recommended)

You can choose to run TPFC at startup:

- Right-click on fancontrol.exe and select copy
- Press Windows-r or search for run in the start menu
- Type `shell:startup` in the run box
- Right click in the window that opens and select paste shortcut

Note: This won't start TPFC until you reboot.


## Uninstall

Delete the folder containing the program and the ini file.

That's it, there's no residual files.

If you added the program to run at startup, you will have to also delete the shortcut from the start up folder.

## Known Issues

On single-fan devices, the fan speed will sometimes fail to show up. The problem is in the process of being fixed

Sometimes the fans will fail to sync, with one ramping up and the other not.
This will usually fix itself, but to fix it manually, switch to BIOS mode, then switch back to the desired mode

It will also sometimes take a longer time for the speed to update and the fans to spin up.
This is caused by EC management for the newer ThinkPad BIOS. There is currently no way around it.

### ThinkPad P50

P50 Laptop users should use the 2.1.5B release as the fan control parameters are different, but the temperature is currently broken in the build, so it is recommended to 
use it in manual mode only

### ThinkPad Z13

Please use FanDjango's [V2.2.5 release](https://github.com/FanDjango/TPFanCtrl2/releases/tag/V2.2.5)

### Thinkbooks

Some thinkbook models have different EC address, so the program might not work
